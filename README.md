# ctf_tool

USAGE: ./ctf_tool 10.10.11.86 example.htb

Just a simple tool that automates the boring tasks at the start of every CTF such as nmap scan and directory scanning if websites were found.
It takes advantage of the prewritten tools such as nmap and ffuf since I didn't want to reinvent the wheel.
