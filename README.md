# ctf_tool

You'll need to install tools nmap, fuff and dirscanner

USAGE: ./recon.sh 10.10.11.86

Just a simple tool that automates the boring tasks at the start of every CTF such as nmap scan and directory scanning if websites were found.
It takes advantage of the prewritten tools such as nmap, dirsearch and ffuf since I didn't want to re-invent tools that are already existing.
