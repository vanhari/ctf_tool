# ctf_tool

You'll need to run the script with root permissions. Also you need to install nmap and ffuf.
USAGE: sudo ./recon.sh 10.10.11.86

Just a simple tool that automates the boring tasks at the start of every CTF such as nmap scan and directory scanning if websites were found.
It takes advantage of the prewritten tools such as nmap and ffuf since I didn't want to reinvent the wheel.
